Session 3: Technique
Strategy Implementation Methodology

## Slide 2

Ingredients of Approach
Newell & Simon, General Problem Solver (early AI)
Analyse difference between current state and goal state
Work backwards from goal to now
The goal is clear but the path is murky
Richard Rumelt’s Good Strategy / Bad Strategy
Diagnosis – what actually matters here?
Guiding policy – how will we win?
Coherent actions – what must be true if this is right?
Hoshin Kanri (“compass management”)
A breakthrough objective (3–5 years)
Annual objectives that explicitly advance the breakthrough
Regular check-ins that ask:
Are we on course?
What did we learn?
What must change?
What moved since last month?
Evidence, not activity.
What did we learn that changes our beliefs?
This keeps strategy alive.
What is now the biggest risk to the next milestone?
Not the plan. The next step.
What are we committing to before the next review?
1–3 commitments, owned, time-boxed.
Reverse Means-End Analysis
Strategy as a Set of Hypotheses
Strategy Deployment
Monthly “Trajectory Reviews”

## Slide 3

Long Range Intent (3-5 Years)
Medium Range Theses (12-36 Months)
Near-term Proof Points (90-180 days)
Execution & Learning Loop (Monthly Cadence)
The Method

## Slide 4

1
If we were already there, what would have had to become true?
It’s 2029. This company is unequivocally successful.
Customers choose us for X.
We generate value by Y.
We are operationally known for Z.

## Slide 5

2
For that to be true, what had to change in the business?
You are not listing initiatives. You are naming state changes:
Capabilities we must possess
Market positions we must hold
Economic properties that must exist
Organisational behaviours that must be normal
Good theses sound like:
“We have repeatable enterprise sales, not heroic ones”
“Our product is the default integration hub in this niche”
“We can onboard a customer in days, not months”
If a statement doesn’t describe a new normal, it’s not a thesis.

## Slide 6

3
If this thesis were already starting to prove true, what would we be able to point to by the next milestone?
Examples:
First customer behaving in the new way
Sales cycle shortened once, not always
A manual process made boring and repeatable
A metric moving for the right reason
Crucially:
👉 Proof points are observable, not promises.

## Slide 7

4
Are the indicators we expected actually showing up?
And if not:
Is the thesis false?
Is the time horizon wrong?
Or are we blocked on a specific constraint?
This keeps strategy alive without constant rewrites.

## Slide 8

Core Principles (→ Psychological Safety)
No one is punished for being wrong.
Being wrong quickly is better than being vaguely right slowly.
Strategy is a learning process. The best strategic learning comes from either:
disproving something we assumed was true, or
proving something we were genuinely uncertain about.
Authority does not equal infallibility.

## Slide 9

Where will we play?
What capabilities must be in place?
How will we win?
What management systems are required?
What is our winning aspiration?
Playing to Win

## Slide 10

Where will we play?
What capabilities must be in place?
How will we win?
What management systems are required?
What is our winning aspiration?
Playing to Win
Stage 1 - Intent
Stage 2 - Theses
Stage 3 –
Proof Points
Stage 4 - Cadence
We’re using Playing to Win to articulate what winning means, and a reverse means–end approach to test whether we’re actually becoming that company.

## Slide 11

More on Theses
1) The Core Move: From “We will…” to “It will be true that…”
A strategy statement often sounds like:
“We will improve onboarding.”
A thesis sounds like:
“Onboarding will become boring and repeatable, and customers will be live in days not weeks.”
Trick:
Force every thesis to be written as a new normal, not an action.

## Slide 12

More on Theses
2) The “If this isn’t true, it’s false” test
This is the cleanest thesis filter.
Ask:
“If this doesn’t become true, does the strategy still work?”
If no → it’s a real thesis
If yes → it’s probably an initiative or nice-to-have
This is how you avoid having 12 “theses”.

## Slide 13

More on Theses
2) The “If this isn’t true, it’s false” test
This is the cleanest thesis filter.
Ask:
“If this doesn’t become true, does the strategy still work?”
If no → it’s a real thesis
If yes → it’s probably an initiative or nice-to-have
This is how you avoid having 12 “theses”.

## Slide 14

Market
“The market will reward X.”
Differentiation
“We will win because of X.”
“Competitors can’t easily copy Y.”
Distribution
“Channel will scale.”
“OEM embedding will become a growth engine.”
Buyer / Adoption
“The buyer will pay for X.”
“IT will standardise around Y.”
Capability
“We can become good at X.”
“We can execute Y reliably.”
Category
“This category will shift toward Y.”
The 6 Thesis Types
3) The 6 Thesis Types

## Slide 15

More on Theses
4) The “Reverse Ladder” technique
Start from the end state and ask repeatedly: “What must be true for that to be true?”
Example:
Intent: “IT specifies us by default for meeting rooms.”
What must be true?
“We are the lowest-risk option at scale.”
What must be true for that?
“We are residue-free and centrally controllable.”
What must be true for that?
“Reset is reliable, governance is easy, compliance is boring.”
You stop when you reach statements that feel:
Fundamental, risky, and not yet proven
Those are your theses.

## Slide 16

More on Theses
5) The “One sentence, two clauses” rule
A thesis should fit into one sentence with a causal shape:
“If we do X, then Y will become true.”
or
“Because customers value X, they will choose us for Y.”
This stops theses becoming vague.
Bad thesis:  “We will be best in class.”
Good thesis: “If we become the easiest product to govern at scale, IT will standardise on us.”

## Slide 17

More on Theses
6) The “No internal language” rule
A thesis must be expressible without internal jargon.
If it can’t be said in customer language, it’s probably not a thesis. It’s a plan.
Prompt:
“How would a customer describe this being true?”

## Slide 18

More on Theses
7) The “3–5 theses only” constraint (non-negotiable)
This is not a style choice. It’s structural.
More than 5 theses means:
the strategy is actually a list
attention will fragment
proof points become meaningless

## Slide 19

More on Theses
8) Not All Thesis Outcomes Are Equal
| Thesis Proves False | Thesis Proves True |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High Learning
(Hidden assumption exposed) | Low Learning
(Comfort) | Safe Thesis |
| Low/Medium Learning
(Avoided a costly illusion) | High Learning
(New Capability Unlocked) | Risky Thesis |

## Slide 20

More on Theses
SAFE + TRUE (Low Learning)
Artifax example:
“Arts organisations still need operational software.”
If true: reassuring, but unsurprising.
SAFE + FALSE (High Learning)
DisplayNote example:
“If the product is reliable and low-residue, users will adopt it naturally.”
If it proves FALSE you discover:
behaviour change is the real barrier
training / defaults / room setup matter more than product quality
adoption requires institutional nudges
That would change the product and go-to-market shape.
RISKY + TRUE (High Learning)
Aion example:
“Universities will pay a meaningful premium for agentic decision support.”
If true: unlocks price expansion and category leadership.
That’s transformational.
RISKY + FALSE (Moderate Learning)
Artifax example:
“North America can scale at the same efficiency as EMEA immediately.”
If false: you prevent overextension and recalibrate expansion.
Still valuable — but less surprising.

## Slide 21

More on Theses
9) Common failure modes
Theses written as projects (“implement CRM”)
Theses written as slogans (“be world class”)
Too many theses
Theses that are actually KPIs (“increase NRR to 120%”)
Theses that are purely internal (“restructure the team”)
We’re not banning these things. We’re just not calling them theses.

## Slide 22

Lifecycle Implications
The problem
Strategy often fails because we apply the wrong behaviours to the right idea.
Scaling too early
Optimising too late
Reinventing when we should replicate
Polishing when we should experiment
The principle
Every lifecycle lane demands a different kind of discipline.

## Slide 23

Lifecycle Implications
Primary focus in this lane
Ask:
“What does success look like in this phase, not in general?”
Examples:
Build → Learning velocity
Sell → Replication and distribution
Milk → Cash durability and risk management
Keep it to one sentence.
What must we resist?
This is critical.
Every phase has a natural temptation:
Build → premature scaling
Sell → feature creep / reinvention
Milk → complacency / underinvestment
Prompt: “If we drift off-course in this phase, what will it look like?”
This prevents unconscious slippage.

## Slide 24

Lifecycle Implications
What good discipline looks like
Make it concrete.
Build → experiments, fast iteration, sharp feedback loops
Sell → standardisation, channel clarity, sales process discipline
Milk → cost control, pricing discipline, service reliability
This section becomes the behavioural guardrails.
Lifecycle Implications is where we make peace with what kind of work this phase requires.

## Slide 25

More on Proof Points
The Core Principle
A thesis is a belief about how value will be created.
A proof point is early evidence that the belief is strengthening or weakening.
Key distinction:
Thesis = theory
Proof point = smoke before fire
KPI = outcome (often lagging)
You are not jumping straight to KPIs.
You are looking for directional signals.

## Slide 26

More on Proof Points
Three Questions to Derive Proof Points
When you have a thesis, ask:
Q1: If this thesis is true, what would we start to notice in the real world?
Not: “What would we do?”
But: “What would change externally?”
Q2: What would customers or partners say differently?
Language is an early indicator.
Examples:
Prospects repeat your positioning unprompted
Buyers shift the evaluation criteria
Internal champions appear
Q3: What behaviour would shift?
Examples:
Shorter sales cycles
Higher renewal uplift acceptance
Increased admin engagement
More unsolicited inbound

## Slide 27

More on Proof Points
Good vs Weak Proof Points
Weak:
“Launched new partner programme”
“Improved documentation”
“Held training sessions”
These are activities.
Strong:
“Partner-led deals now closing without founder involvement”
“Customers accept 8% price increase without pushback”
“IT raises governance as a primary buying criterion”
These are behavioural signals.
Proof Points Should Be:
Observable
External where possible
Lifecycle-appropriate
Early enough to steer
And ideally:
Slightly uncomfortable
If every proof point is easy to hit, the thesis isn’t being tested.

## Slide 28

More on Execution and Monitoring Cadence
The Purpose of the Cadence
This is not:
Performance review
RAG status update
Blame session
It is:
A structured check on whether our theses are strengthening or weakening.
You are steering, not judging.

## Slide 29

More on Execution and Monitoring Cadence
The Monthly Loop
1) What moved? (evidence)
This updates your proof points.
2) What did we learn?
This updates thesis health:
strengthening / weakening / unclear / invalidated
3) What now threatens the next proof point?
This becomes:
Current Bottleneck
4) What are the 1–3 commitments to next review?
This becomes:
Commitments
5) What are we primarily testing next month?
This becomes:
Primary Thesis (or proof point)

## Slide 30

More on Execution and Monitoring Cadence
Language Matters
Avoid:
Green / Amber / Red
On track / Off track
Use:
Strengthening
Weakening
Unclear
Invalidated (which then leads to a review of how critical this thesis is for the strategy)
This reduces defensiveness and increases honesty.

## Slide 31

More on Execution and Monitoring Cadence
The Reframe Trigger (Thesis)
A thesis enters Reframe territory when:
Proof points consistently contradict the thesis
The team keeps changing explanation to protect it
Energy feels reactive rather than oriented
The Reframe Trigger (Strategy)
A strategy enters Reframe territory when:
Load-bearing theses fail
Reframe is not failure.
It’s disciplined recalibration.

## Slide 32

More on Execution and Monitoring Cadence
The Attention Marker (GM)
Each month:
GM marks one thesis as primary focus
You mark one thesis across the portfolio where your attention adds leverage
This prevents diffusion and forces priority.
The Attention Marker (GL)
Each month, I’ll mark one thesis across the portfolio where my attention can help move the dial. That might be opening a door, testing a hypothesis externally, or removing a constraint.

## Slide 33

Primary Constraint/Risk
The Primary Constraint is the current bottleneck preventing your most important thesis from strengthening.
Without this, strategy becomes:
too broad
too polite
too distributed
The Primary Constraint forces us to confront:
“If everything is important, nothing is.”
It creates focus.

## Slide 34

Primary Constraint/Risk
How to Identify the Primary Constraint
Ask three questions:
1. What blocks the next proof point?
Not: “What could go wrong in theory?”
But: “What would stop the next visible signal from appearing?”
Keep it short-range and concrete.
2. Is this structural or executional?
Structural =
market misunderstanding
capability gap
positioning flaw
Executional =
bandwidth
systems
process
Both are valid, but clarity matters.
3. If we fixed only one thing in the next 60 days, what would change the trajectory most?
That’s usually your constraint.
What this section is NOT
It is not:
a full risk register
a SWOT analysis
a compliance checklist

## Slide 35

Primary Constraint/Risk
Relationship to Reframe
If the Primary Constraint is tactical → steer
If the Primary Constraint reveals a broken thesis → reconsider
If multiple constraints cluster around invalidated theses → Reframe
Lifecycle Implications tells us how to behave.
Primary Constraint tells us where to focus.
A thesis tells us what must become true.
A proof point tells us whether it is becoming true.
The primary constraint tells us what is stopping it.

## Slide 36

Primary Constraint/Risk
Concrete Example: DisplayNote
Thesis
“Channel partners can become a repeatable growth engine.”
Proof point
Partner-led deals closing without founder involvement.
Now ask:
What is stopping that proof point from showing up?
Possible answers:
Partner onboarding is too complex.
We lack partner training material.
Margin structure isn’t attractive enough.
One of those becomes the Primary Constraint.
Notice:
It is not the thesis.
It is not the proof.
It is the current blocker.

## Slide 37

Primary Constraint/Risk
Concrete Example: Aion
Thesis
“Universities will pay a premium for agentic decision support.”
Proof point
First premium deal closes.
Constraint might be:
Value proposition not legible.
Pricing model unclear.
Sales team not confident selling premium.
Again:
The thesis is about market belief.
The constraint is about what blocks evidence of that belief.

## Slide 38

Primary Constraint/Risk
Relationship to Reframe
If the Primary Constraint is tactical → steer
If the Primary Constraint reveals a broken thesis → reconsider
If multiple constraints cluster around invalidated theses → Reframe
Lifecycle Implications tells us how to behave.
Primary Constraint tells us where to focus.
A thesis tells us what must become true.
A proof point tells us whether it is becoming true.
The primary constraint tells us what is stopping it.
Theses are what must become true.
Constraints are what must stop being true.
