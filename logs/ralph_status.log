RECOMMENDATION: Next invocation will detect unchecked issues in code-review.md → enter fix mode. Spawn fix agents grouped by reviewer tag. Check for multi-reviewer file conflicts first (canvas_service.py, portfolio/service.py, attachment routes, api/client.ts all have issues from 2+ reviewers) → run herald before fix batch.
