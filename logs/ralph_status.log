All 15 issues marked [x]. However, test suite shows 34 failures (was 275 pass/0 fail). Deleted test-suite-report.md to trigger re-entry into test-suite phase.

RECOMMENDATION: Next invocation will detect smoke-test PASS + no test-suite-report.md → enters test-suite phase to fix 34 broken tests. Key failure areas: health_contract (3), auth_routes (1), portfolio_routes (2), canvas API tests (5+9+6+5+3=28). Likely causes: (1) CR-073 removed refresh_token from login response breaking auth test, (2) CR-084 health check now returns 503 when DB unreachable breaking health contract tests, (3) CR-072 portfolio service timedelta change may affect query results.
