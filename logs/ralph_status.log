CURRENT_MODE: verify
CURRENT_FEATURE: all
ACTION_COMPLETED: Verify run 6 - 5/7 agents PASS, 2 FAIL (verify-schema: 9 representation mismatches, verify-scope: 3 stale file-map entries). All fixes applied. Counter at 0.

FEATURES_VERIFIED: 0
RECOMMENDATION: Run verify again (run 7). Need 2 consecutive clean passes to advance to verify-all. The schema mismatches were representation differences (SQLAlchemy vs SQL syntax) now aligned. The file-map CREATE/CREATE conflicts were stale entries already fixed in task files. Run 7 should be clean if no new issues surface.
