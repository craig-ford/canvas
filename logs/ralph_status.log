CURRENT_FEATURE: all
ACTION_COMPLETED: Test-suite phase attempt 1. Fixed 2 code issues (SQLEnum values_callable for 4 enums, reserved word quoting in 2 CHECK constraints). Tests: 127 passed, 50 failed, 89 errors out of 266 total. Root cause: test fixtures don't match conftest.py (89 errors) and test assertions don't match actual API responses (50 failures). Frontend tests not runnable (no vitest configured).

FEATURES_VERIFIED: 5
RECOMMENDATION: Continue test-suite phase. Priority: (1) Add missing fixtures to conftest.py to resolve 89 errors, (2) Fix 50 test assertion mismatches, (3) Add vitest to frontend and run frontend tests. The test deps (pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx) need to be added to Dockerfile or requirements-dev.txt permanently.
