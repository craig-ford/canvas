CURRENT_FEATURE: all
ACTION_COMPLETED: Test-suite attempt 2 — fixed 2 shared root causes (canvas_b fixture, stale container files), delegated 50 failures to 4 test-fixer subagents, reduced from 59 failed + 10 errors to 40 failed + 0 errors. Also fixed PDF template path and reviews router Pydantic compat.

RECOMMENDATION: Re-enter smoke-test (test-suite phase). 40 tests still failing across 11 files. Run tests, check specific failure tracebacks, delegate another round of test-fixer subagents. Focus on: (1) PDF routes still 500 — check if template path fix was applied correctly, (2) proof point API — 8 failures likely wrong API paths or response shapes, (3) reviews — 10 failures across 3 files. Read one failing test per file with --tb=long to diagnose before delegating.
