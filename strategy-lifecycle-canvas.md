# Strategy + Lifecycle Canvas

*A living artefact for GM focus, momentum, and learning.*

## Context

**VBU / Company:**\
**Product / Product Group:**\
**Lifecycle Lane (circle one):** ⬤ Build ⬤ Sell ⬤ Milk ⬤ Reframe

**In this lane, success over the next 12--24 months primarily means:**\
*(one sentence)*

## 1. Future State Intent (3--5 years, spoken as fact)

*"It's 20XX. This product/company is unquestionably successful. In the
real world, what is now true?"*

*(Describe how customers, partners, and the market experience us. Avoid
initiatives.)*

## 2. Strategic Theses (What must have become true)

*State changes required for the future state to exist.*

**Thesis 1:**\
**Thesis 2:**\
**Thesis 3:**\
**Thesis 4 (optional):**\
**Thesis 5 (optional):**

*(3--5 only. Phrase as new normals, not projects.)*

## 3. Lifecycle Implications (fit-for-purpose discipline)

**Primary focus in this lane:**\
*(Learning / Replication / Cash & Risk)*

**What we must resist doing in this lane:**\
*(e.g. premature scaling, reinvention, gold-plating)*

**What good discipline looks like here:**\
*(e.g. experiments, standardisation, cost control)*

## 4. Proof Points (Evidence we expect next)

*If these theses are starting to be true, what would we be able to point
to in 3--6 months?*

- **Thesis 1 proof:**
- **Thesis 2 proof:**
- **Thesis 3 proof:**
- **Thesis 4 proof (optional):**
- **Thesis 5 proof (optional):**

*(Observable signals, not activities. Fit the lifecycle lane.)*

## 5. Primary Constraint / Risk

*The single biggest thing that could block the next proof point.*

## 6. Cadence Commitments (next monthly review)

## **Before the next check-in, we commit to:**

**At the next review, we are primarily testing:**\
*(which thesis or proof point)*

### Monthly Review Prompts (use every time)

1.  What moved since last month (evidence)?

<!-- -->

1.  What did we learn that changes our beliefs?
2.  What now threatens the *next* proof point?
3.  What are the 1--3 commitments to the next review?
