# Ralph Fix Plan

This is the simple task list for projects without full SDD structure.
For complex projects, use `mode:bootstrap` to generate specs/ structure.

## High Priority
- [ ] Set up basic project structure and build system
- [ ] Define core data structures and types
- [ ] Implement basic input/output handling
- [ ] Create test framework and initial tests

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Implement core business logic
- [ ] Add configuration management
- [ ] Create user documentation

## Low Priority
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Extended feature set
- [ ] Integration with external services
- [ ] Advanced error recovery

## Completed
- [x] Project initialization

## Notes
- Focus on MVP functionality first
- Ensure each feature is properly tested
- Update this file after each major milestone
- For complex projects, run `mode:bootstrap` to generate full SDD structure
